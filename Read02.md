#### Git is the most widely used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to the files, so that you have a record of what's done, and you can go back to certain versions if you need to. Git also facilitates collaboration, allowing multiple-person changes to be combined into a single source.
#### For example, (when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, and why. Git isn't the only version control system out there, but it's by far the most popular).

## How Git works?

#### The basic principle of Git, once you understand it, is spectacularly simple.

#### First, Git deals with content in the footage, one for each commitment, and knows how to apply or retract sets of changes between two shots. That's an important concept. In my view, understanding the concept of applying and regressing change groups makes it much easier to understand and work with Git.

#### To start working with Git, you just turn on the git init command. Converts the current directory to the Git workbook and creates the repository in the directory. You can then start working with Git. Drag and commitment orders are similar to other source code repositories, but the focus on change groups is why you get the Add command in Git (similar to SVN). Using this command, a change in the workshop manual is added to the phase area for the next commitment. The area of the gradient is usually called the index.
