## What is CSS and why it is used?
#### CSS is a markup language that describes the layout and colors of web pages. It can be used to modify the presentation of web pages to fit different devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.

## How to Add CSS?

### CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

* **Inline**- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
* **Internal** - by using a <style> element in the <head> section.
* **External** - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file.

#### The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.

## What is color in CSS?

#### The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text and text decorations, and sets the <currentcolor> value. currentcolor may be used as an indirect value on other properties and is the default for other color properties, such as border-color 

## How to know CSS color?

#### Probably the most common (yet least intuitive) way to specify colors in CSS is to use their hexadecimal (or hex) values. Hex values are actually just a different way to represent RGB values. Instead of using three numbers between 0 and 255 , you use six hexadecimal numbers. Hex numbers can be 0-9 and A-F

## What is Reset CSS?

#### A CSS Reset (or “Reset CSS”) is a short, often compressed (minified) set of CSS rules that resets the styling of all HTML elements to a consistent baseline. In case you didn't know, every browser has its own default 'user agent' stylesheet, that it uses to make unstyled websites appear more legible.

#### The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on.
#### Reset styles quite often appear in CSS frameworks, and the original "meyerweb reset" found its way into Blueprint, among others.
