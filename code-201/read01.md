## What is HTML?
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup system used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of applications.

## HTML Structure

HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content. HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

### HTML Page Structure

Below is an HTML page structure:

## What is HTML layouts
HTML layouts provide a way to arrange web pages in well-mannered, well-structured, and in responsive form or we can say that HTML layout specifies a way in which the web pages can be arranged.

## What is HTML Process & Design?

A Web development process is a documented outline of the steps needed to be taken from start to finish in order to complete a typical Web design project. ... It divides and categorizes the work and then breaks these high-level sections into tasks and resources that can be used as a road map for each project.

### steps to design a website requires:

* Goal identification: Where I work with the client to determine what goals the new website needs to fulfill. I.e., what its purpose is.
* Scope definition: Once we know the site's goals, we can define the scope of the project. I.e., what web pages and features the site requires to fulfill the goal, and the timeline for building those out.
* Sitemap and wireframe creation: With the scope well-defined, we can start digging into the sitemap, defining how the content and features we defined in scope definition will interrelate.
* Content creation: Now that we have a bigger picture of the site in mind, we can start creating content for the individual pages, always keeping search engine optimization (SEO) in mind to help keep pages focused on a single topic. 
* Visual elements: With the site architecture and some content in place, we can start working on the visual brand. Depending on the client, this may already be well-defined, but you might also be defining the visual style from the ground up. Tools like style tiles, moodboards, and element collages can help with this process.
* Testing: By now, you've got all your pages and defined how they display to the site visitor, so it's time to make sure it all works. Combine manual browsing of the site on a variety of devices with automated site crawlers to identify everything from user experience issues to simple broken links.
* Launch: Once everything's working beautifully, it's time to plan and execute your site launch! This should include planning both launch timing and communication strategies â€” i.e., when will you launch and how will you let the world know? After that, it's time to break out the bubbly.

# Java Script
![JS](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/img_js.png)

## What is JS and why it is used?

JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.

# The ABC of programming
## A: What is a script and how do I create one? 
A script is  a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You could compare scripts to any of the following: 

### RECIPES 
By fo llowing the instructions in a recipe, one-by-one in t he order set out, cooks can create a dish they have never made before.

Some scripts are simple and only deal with one individual scenario, like a simple recipe for a basic dish. Other scripts can perform many tasks, like a recipe for a complicated three-course meal.

### HANDBOOKS
 Large companies often provide handbooks for new employees that contain procedures to fo llow in certain situations.

  For example, hotel handbooks may contain steps to follow in different scenarios such as when a guest checks in, when a room needs to be tidied, w hen a fire alarm goes off, and so forth. 
  
  In any of these scenarios, the employees need to follow only the steps for that one type of event. (You would not want someone going through every single step in the entire handbook while you were waiting to check in.) 
  Similarly, in a complex script, the browser might use only a subset of the code available at any given time.

  ### MANUALS 
  Mechanics often refer to car repair manuals when ser vicing models they are not familiar with. These manuals contain a series of tests to check the key functions of the car are working, along with details of how to fix any issues that arise. 
  
  For example, there might be details about how to test the brakes. If they pass this test, the mechanic can then go on to the next test without needing to fix the brakes. But, if they fail, the mechanic will need to follow the instructions to repair them. 
  
  The mechanic can then go back and test the brakes again to see if the problem is fixed. If the brakes now pass the test, the mechanic knows they are fixed and can move onto the next test. 
  
  Sim ilarly, scripts can allow the browser to check the current situation and only perform a set of steps if that action is appropriate. 


## B: How do computer  s fit in with the world around them?

COMPUTERS CREATE MODELS OF THE WORLD USING DATA 

A computer has no predefined concept of what a hotel or car is. It does not know w hat they are used for. Your laptop or phone will not have a favorite brand of car, nor will it know what star rating your hotel is.

 So how do we use computers to create hotel booking apps, or video games where players can race a car? The answer is that programmers create a very different kind of model, especially for computers. 
 
 
OBJECT TYPE: HOTEL Programmers make these models using data. That is not as strange or as scary as it sounds because the data is all t he computer needs in order to follow the instructions you give it to carry out its tasks. 


 ## METHODS
 Methods represent things people need to do with objects. 
 
 WHAT IS A METHOD?
 
  Methods typically represent how people (or other things) interact with an object in the real world.  
 
 They are like questions and instructions th at: 
 *  Tell you something about that object (using information stored in its properties). 
 *  Change t he value of one or more of that object's properties.

 WHAT DOES A METHOD DO?
 
  The code for a method can contain lots of instructions that together represent one task. 
  
  When you use a method, you do not always need to know how it achieves its task; you just need to know how to ask the question and how to interpret any answers it gives you. 


### C: How do I write a script for a web page?

#### HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER?

Before diving into the JavaScript  language, you need to know how it will fit together with the HTML and CSS in your web pages. 

### html
Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

 CONTENT LAYER 

  .html files 
  
  This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page struct ure and adds semantics. 

  ### css

  Where possible, aim to keep the three languages in separate fi les, with the HTML page linking to CSS and JavaScript files.
  
   PRESENTATION LAYER 
   
   . css files 
   
   The CSS enhances t he HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.)

   ### JS
   Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose. Each layer, from left to right. builds on the previous one.
   
   BEHAVIOR LAYER 
   
   .js files 
   
   This is w here we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.
