# Functions in JS
## What is Functions in JS?
#### In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want. A JavaScript function can be defined using function keyword. Syntax: ... This function can be execute using () operator, for example: ShowMessage().

## Defining functions
#### A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

* The name of the function.
* A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
* The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

## Control flow
### What is Control flow?
#### The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

### Why do we need control flow?
#### Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.
