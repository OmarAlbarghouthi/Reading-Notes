## What is JavaScript?
#### JavaScript is a programming language that allows developers to create interactive web pages. Most of the time, web pages are composed of predefined text, but JavaScript adds interactivity to them.
#### Where HTML and CSS provide structure and style to web pages (HTML and CSS), JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
#### examples of JavaScript that you might use every day include the search box on Amazon, a news recap video embedded on The New York Times, or refreshing your Twitter feed. Incorporating JavaScript improves the user experience of the web page by converting it from a static page into an interactive one. To recap, JavaScript adds behavior to web pages.

## What is JavaScript used for?
JavaScript is mainly used for web-based applications and web browsers. But JavaScript is also used beyond the Web in software, servers and embedded hardware controls. Here are some basic things JavaScript is used for:

 

1. **Adding interactive behavior to web pages**

#### JavaScript allows users to interact with web pages. There are almost no limits to the things you can do with JavaScript on a web page – these are just a few examples:

* Show or hide more information with the click of a button

* Change the color of a button when the mouse hovers over it

* Slide through a carousel of images on the homepage

* Zooming in or zooming out on an image

* Displaying a timer or count-down on a website

* Playing audio and video in a web page

* Displaying animations

* Using a drop-down hamburger menu

 

2.  **Creating web and mobile **
#### Developers can use various JavaScript frameworks for developing and building web and mobile apps. JavaScript frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries that provide developers with pre-written code to use for routine programming features and tasks—literally a framework to build websites or web applications around. 

#### Popular JavaScript front-end frameworks include React, React Native, Angular, and Vue. Many companies use Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript V8 engine. A few famous examples include Paypal, LinkedIn, Netflix, and Uber!

 

3.  **Building web servers and developing server applications**

#### Beyond websites and apps, developers can also use JavaScript to build simple web servers and develop the back-end infrastructure using Node.js. 

 
4.  **Game development**

#### Of course, you can also use JavaScript to create browser games. These are a great way for beginning developers to practice their JavaScript skills.

## Why use JavaScript over other programming languages? 

#### Aside from the unlimited possibilities, there are many reasons for web developers to use JavaScript over other programming languages:

* JavaScript is the only programming language native to the web browser

* JavaScript is the most popular language

* There’s a low threshold to get started

* It’s a fun language to learn
